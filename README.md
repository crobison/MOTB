MOTB Assessment

This project uses Laravel 5.2 with laravelcollective and LAMP stack on Amazon EC2 Ubuntu 16.04 instance.

I was unable to complete this assessment on time. My first 3 evenings were spent setting up the environment.
I am not able to use Homestead/Vagrant.
My first attempt used Amazon-Linux instance (based on CentOS). Several things went wrong and there wasn't much
documentation for that specific linux distribution. I switched to Ubuntu and composer/Laravel + dependencies 
installed painlessly. I then proceeded to completely bork my environment trying to add LaravelCollective for
cool forms in blade (I later found this was due to a misconfigured path for composer). By my 4th attempt, it was 
day 3.

What was completed?
* Registered Users
* Note CRUD operations with Views
* Deleted Note recovery with View (in nav bar)

What was not completed?
* Sharing

I worked with Laravel for 8 months at a web development firm in OKC. I'd forgotten how fun it can be, but I never 
experienced it's full potential.

I'm submitting this project incomplete in hopes that I can start a deep dive in the framework and become an expert.
